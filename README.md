- `DecisionTree.py`: Decision Tree

## Unsupervised Learning
- `KMeansClustering.py`: K-Means Clustering
- `PCA.py`: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Reinforcement Learning
- `QLearning.py`: Q-Learning
- `DQN.py`: Deep Q-Network (DQN)

## Deep Learning
- `Neural_Network.py`: Simple Neural Network
- `CNN.py`: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Getting Started

To run any of the algorithms, navigate to the respective directory and execute the Python script. E.g.
```bash
