🎯 **A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, including Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning.**

## 🧐 Why This Repository?
Machine learning is a vast field, and while there are numerous frameworks and libraries available, beginners often struggle to understand the fundamental algorithms that power these frameworks. This repository was created to provide:

- **Clear, well-structured implementations** of popular ML algorithms.
- **Minimal dependencies**, making it easier to experiment and learn without complex setups.
- **Categorized ML techniques**, covering different learning paradigms for structured understanding.
- **A foundation for further exploration**, enabling users to modify, extend, and integrate these algorithms into their own projects.

Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced developer wanting quick reference implementations, this repository aims to be a practical, educational, and accessible resource.

🔥 **If you find this repo useful, please consider** ⭐ **starring it!** It helps others discover it.
