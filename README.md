## 📊 Algorithm Comparison
| Algorithm | Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------|-----------|------------|
| Linear Regression | Supervised | Simple, interpretable, fast | Sensitive to outliers |
| Decision Tree | Supervised | Easy to interpret, non-linear relationships | Prone to overfitting |
| K-Means Clustering | Unsupervised | Fast and scalable | Assumes spherical clusters |
| PCA | Unsupervised | Reduces dimensionality, speeds up computation | Loses some interpretability |
| Q-Learning | Reinforcement | Learns optimal policies | Can be computationally expensive |
| Deep Q-Network (DQN) | Reinforcement | Handles large state spaces well | Requires a lot of training data |
| Simple Neural Network | Deep Learning | Learns complex patterns | Requires a lot of data |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Deep Learning | Excellent for image processing | Computationally intensive |
